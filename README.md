# cjgConsoleDrawer  

This is a small project for learning about drawing to the console using the windows API. The code is not efficient, but it is possible to create static drawings and small animations.

The ```main.cpp``` contains a small sample code of how to use the different methods of drawing **blocks**, **lines**, **rectangles** and **triangles**. Does note support **circles** yet.

By simply including the ```cjgConsoleDrawer.h``` to your project will grant you to use the class.
